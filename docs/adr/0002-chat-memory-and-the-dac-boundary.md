# ADR-0002: Conversation Memory and the DaC Boundary

> **⚠ IMPLEMENTATION STATUS (2026-07-23):** the boundary decision holds and
> Tier-1 chat memory is shipped, but the **Tier-2 user-understanding fact
> store** this ADR references (`recall_user_facts`, fact distillation,
> `lab/pkb/understanding/`) is **not yet built**. Treat Tier-2 mentions as the
> ratified design, not current behavior.

**Status:** Accepted (Tier-2 fact store: design ratified, not yet implemented)
**Date:** 2026-07-16
**Deciders:** QuKaiZen
**Relates:** `docs/conversation-memory.md` (the schema contract), `docs/agents.md` (memory model),
`sprints/2026-07-16-arail-chat-memory/ARCHITECTURE.md` (the design)

## Context

ARAIL's Chat tab loses its conversation on every tab switch or reload, and the lab retains no
record of past conversations at all. Two things are wanted: live continuity (the current
conversation survives navigation, including an in-flight response), and durable understanding
(a retained record the lab's agents can use to understand the user across sessions).

The request was that this data be "governed by DaC" — the sibling QuKaiZen project
(`~/ProJects/qukaizen-ddac`), which the workspace describes as the declarative layer for what
agents know and can say. Taking that literally would mean routing per-user conversation
history through DaC's pipeline. Investigation showed that would fight DaC's design rather than
extend it, so the boundary needs to be recorded explicitly — otherwise the next sprint
re-litigates it, or worse, quietly builds the wrong thing.

**What DaC actually is today** (verified against the DaC working tree, 2026-07-16): an
offline, build-time authoring pipeline. It compiles curated Knowledge World content from
OKF markdown through a gate/provenance step into static artifacts. It has no runtime, no
client library, and no write API.

## Decision

**Adopt DaC's discipline. Do not route conversation data through DaC's pipeline. Do not claim
DaC governs chat memory at runtime.**

**DaC is the control plane; ARAIL is the data plane.** DaC declares contracts and compiles
their enforcement; it does not store instance data. Conversation transcripts and per-user
facts are instance data, and they live in ARAIL, under the PKB root.

### Why not route through DaC

1. **DaC defines itself against this exact use case.** `CONTEXT_VM.md:208-210` draws the
   contrast deliberately: MemGPT "pages *conversation history* in and out of a mutable store";
   CONTEXT_VM pages "a gate-verified, immutable, symbolic graph." Chat memory is mutable,
   private, per-user, high-volume, and runtime-written. DaC artifacts are immutable, shared,
   curated, low-volume, and build-time-written. The substrate is opposite on every axis.
2. **Core invariants would break.** DaC's `CLAUDE.md` states "source of truth is OKF markdown"
   (chat turns are not authored markdown) and "never commit compiled TOON/BTOON as source"
   (private conversation data must never be committed). DaC's gate requires every term to cite
   a locatable *corpus* source; a user saying "I prefer Rust" has no corpus to cite.
3. **The existing seam points the other way.** DaC's mount contract
   (`0004-dac-arail-mount-contract.md`), Decision 4: "DaC owns the format; ARAIL only reads…
   ARAIL never writes or edits them." Chat memory requires ARAIL to write at runtime,
   inverting the one contract that already exists between these repos.
4. **DaC has no runtime.** Build-time scripts plus a git post-commit hook. DaC's `README.md:55`
   marks write paths "deferred/ROADMAP".
5. **Claiming it would breach DaC's own honesty rail.** DaC's `README.md:57` marks the
   ARAIL←DaC link "declared, narrative only; there is **no artifact yet**", and `:65` states it
   "must never be rendered as a live capability until a real data artifact exists." Shipping
   "chat memory governed by DaC" while DaC does nothing at runtime is exactly what that
   sentence forbids.

DaC's positioning record — `docs/adr/0006-dac-positioning-declarative-control-plane.md` —
canonicalizes it as "the declarative control plane for an agent's I/O boundary." A control
plane governs a boundary by declaring and enforcing a contract. It does not hold the instances
that cross it. The split recorded here *is* that positioning applied honestly.

### Why the discipline nonetheless transfers

This is not a polite gesture toward a sibling project. `DAC_ENGINE.md:153-155` names the
failure mode an autonomous knowledge loop invites: an agent that updates its world from its
own output "hallucinates a world and then believes itself. The gate is what keeps the loop
tethered to reality."

That risk is *identical* here. If Buddy distills "facts about the user" from its own generated
text and reads them back as truth next session, the lab confabulates a user and then believes
it. DaC's loop — declare → reconcile → gate → version → no drift (`DAC_ENGINE.md:65`) — is
the control for precisely the failure mode this feature introduces. The discipline transfers
because the risk is the same; the pipeline does not transfer because the substrate is opposite.

### ARAIL already runs this loop

The discipline is not an import. `pkb.py:666-672` — `search_for_agents` applies the Compiled-KB
gate (`ARAIL_APPROVED_ONLY`) so that "agents build ONLY on approved knowledge." Distilled user
facts are therefore written as PKB markdown notes, which inherit the existing LanceDB index,
`search_for_agents`, the approval gate, and the "wipe the PKB = forget me" contract, with no
new machinery. Markdown-as-source with provenance and a gate before promotion is DaC-shaped by
construction.

### The seam we are deliberately not building

The *schema declaration* — the contract defining what a conversation and a turn are — is the
one artifact that could legitimately become DaC-emitted later (DaC declares, ARAIL
instantiates), consistent with the mount contract's DaC-emits/ARAIL-reads direction. It is
named here as ROADMAP and left unbuilt. We do not fake the wire.

## Consequences

- Chat memory is ARAIL-native. There is **no runtime dependency on DaC**, and none should be
  added without superseding this ADR.
- DaC's `README.md:57` ROADMAP row stays accurate. Nothing in this work makes the ARAIL←DaC
  link live, and no DaC file changes.
- Conversation data lives under the **PKB root**, not `DATA_DIR`, because `docs/agents.md:142-143`
  and `_builtin_buddy.py:198-201` establish "wipe the PKB = wipe memory" as a real privacy
  contract. Siting the most sensitive data in the lab outside that contract would silently
  break it.
- Agents may only build on **approved** user facts. The gate is the reality anchor, not a
  formality: facts are distilled **only from user turns, never from assistant output**, and any
  fact without a locatable verbatim span is rejected.
- The two tiers must not be conflated. The raw transcript is never authoritative about the
  user and is never injected wholesale into agent context.
- If a future sprint wants DaC to emit the conversation schema, that is an additive change to
  the control plane and does not require moving instance data.

## Alternatives considered

**Extend DaC to govern chat memory (build a runtime write path).** Rejected. It breaks four
DaC invariants (OKF-markdown-as-source, never-commit-compiled, the corpus-sourcing gate, and
the mount contract's ARAIL-only-reads direction) and requires building a runtime DaC has never
had — all to ship a chat fix. It would also make DaC's own honesty rail (`README.md:65`) false.

**Have DaC emit the schema now, and codegen ARAIL's store from it.** Rejected for this pass,
retained as ROADMAP. It is the honest version of the integration and would create the real
artifact `README.md:65` demands, but it adds a cross-repo build dependency to ship a chat fix,
and the contract should stabilize in use before it is frozen into a compiled declaration.

**A separate SQLite store outside the PKB.** Rejected. Technically the better substrate for
append-heavy concurrent writes, but it is a wholly new pattern in a repo whose conventions are
append-only JSONL (`activity.py`) and JSON+LanceDB dual-write (`agent_workflows.py`) — and,
decisively, siting conversation data outside the PKB root breaks the documented "wipe the PKB =
wipe memory" contract.
