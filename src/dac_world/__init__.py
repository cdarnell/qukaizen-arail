"""dac_world — DDaC's shared, model-free World forge/seal/gate/skill core.

This package is the single generator for ``dac.world-bundle/v1`` bundles.
qukaizen-arail imports it at runtime (an intentional, human-approved
reversal of the prior "no cross-repo runtime imports" stance — see
``sprints/2026-07-19-dac-generates-arail-worlds/ARCHITECTURE.md`` in
qukaizen-ddac for the full rationale, assumptions, and failure modes).

Everything under this package is pure and stdlib-only: no model calls of
its own (a caller-supplied ``router`` object is required), no filesystem
writes outside ``write_bundle``/``reseal_bundle``, and — enforced by a
static CI check (``tests/python/test_no_arail_backimport.py``) — no
``import arail`` anywhere in this package. Anything that needs ARAIL's
router, async wrapping, cancel-event plumbing, progress-to-SSE, or the
mount-time theme schema stays in ARAIL and is injected in as a parameter
(see ``seal.write_bundle``'s ``theme_validator``).

This top-level namespace re-exports the full public surface that
qukaizen-arail's ``world_forge.py`` shim depends on (grepped from ARAIL's
portal/librarian_scout/tests call sites — see BUILD_LOG.md step 6).
