# Build log: the egress guard covers the httpx family (TD50, runtime half of TD51)

**Architecture:** [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) at `ec2a12be` (accepted by the ledger at `982da749`)
**Branch:** `qukaizen/arail-egress-httpx2` (base `origin/main` `5997363e`, which is #210). Not pushed.
**Started:** 2026-11-01
**This pass:** commits 1 to 4 of the "Atomic commit plan" (the guard and its proof). Commits 5 to 7 are a later builder pass; commit 8 is the orchestrator's, after #211 merges. Nothing below row 4 has been started.
**Status:** in progress (skeleton).

## Hard rules this pass keeps

- The airgapped default and the `allow_egress` ratchet are not relaxed. The audit schema (`url_host`, `caller`, `reason`, `lab_mode`, `ts`) is not changed.
- Not touched: `src/arail/deep_*.py`, `src/dac_world/`, `src/arail/buddy_host/contract/`, `tests/conftest.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `NOTICE`, `THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES`, `licenses/`, `lab/worlds`, `models/graduated`, `eval/`, `research/aerollm`, `docs/archive`; no `aerollm` / `AERO_*` name. `README.md`, `docs/` and the modal are not edited in this pass (commit 6).
- No `importorskip` and no skip for the thing under test in anything written here. No real host is contacted: a URL that must be blocked uses a `.invalid` name.
- The home clone `~/ProJects/qukaizen-arail` is not touched. Nothing is pushed or merged.
- Nothing is created in the worktree except committed files. Venvs, junit XML, logs and scratch trees live in the session scratch directory.

| 3 | `tests/test_egress_httpx_fresh.py` (new); `tests/test_egress_sdk_clients.py` (new); `tests/egress_family_support.py` (extend: `run_fresh`) | The brief's probe in a fresh interpreter, huggingface_hub, and the SDKs' default clients. No source change. | FR-1 to FR-5, SDK-1. Shown failing against commit 1's `egress.py` (a scratch tree), not only passing against commit 2's. | pending |
| 4 | `tests/test_egress_httpx.py` (+EG-23, EG-24); `tests/test_qa_airgap_bypass_attempts.py` (+BY-2, BY-3, BY-4) | Tripwires for an unknown httpx-family module or transport, and pins for the documented lower-layer and proxy gaps. | EG-23, EG-24, BY-2 to BY-4. Each shown to fail on a planted change. | pending |
| 5 | `src/arail/open_notebook_seed.py`; `src/arail/doctor.py`; `tests/test_httpx_family.py` | TD51 runtime consumers. | ON-1, ON-2, DR-1 to DR-3 | later builder pass |
| 6 | README, `docs/PRIVACY.md`, modal, `airgap.py`, `router/core.py`, `portal/app.py`, `tests/test_egress_docs.py`, `tests/test_qa_airgap_happy_setup.py` | Docs say what is wrapped; `KNOWN_GAPS`; status endpoint. | DOC-1 to DOC-5 | later builder pass |
| 7 | `.github/workflows/egress-guard.yml`; `tests/egress_ci_check.py`; `tests/test_egress_ci_check.py` | The five-leg workflow and its checker. | CI-1 to CI-4 | later builder pass |
| 8 | `sprints/BACKLOG.md` + ledger | Close TD50, re-scope TD51, file TD52 to TD55. | none | orchestrator, after #211 merges |

A commit cannot contain its own SHA, so the "Commit ref" of step N is filled in by the next commit's edit of this file. Step 4's is filled in by the next builder pass (and is in this pass's report).

## Verification protocol (every commit)

One pytest process at a time, targeted files only (the orchestrator runs the full suite). Scratch HOME and TMPDIR, scrubbed environment, `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`, junit XML and logs in the session scratch directory. Each venv imports `arail` from this worktree and declares its leg with `ARAIL_TEST_EXPECT_HTTPX_FAMILY`.

| Venv | Library state | Declaration | Used from |
|---|---|---|---|
| ci | httpx2 2.16.0, no httpx (Python 3.11.17) | `httpx2` | commit 1 |
| lock | httpx 0.28.1, no httpx2 (3.11.17) | `httpx` | commit 1 |
| both | httpx 0.28.1 and httpx2 2.16.0 (3.11.17) | `httpx,httpx2` | commit 1 |
| neither | ci with httpx2 and httpcore2 removed (3.11.17) | `none` | commit 2: EG-0 must FAIL with `UNPROVEN`, EG-0b must PASS |
| py310 | httpx2 2.14.0, no httpx (CPython 3.10.22), leg 2 of the CI design | `httpx2` | commit 2 |
| sdk | both libraries plus anthropic 2.3.0, openai 3.42.1, h2, socksio | `httpx,httpx2`, `ARAIL_TEST_EXPECT_SDKS=anthropic,openai` | commit 3: SDK-1 and client shapes |

Files run per commit: the files the commit touches, plus `tests/test_egress_*.py`, `tests/test_qa_airgap_bypass_attempts.py` and `tests/test_queuellm_rename_frozen_surface.py`. At commit 2 (the only commit that changes guard code) also the rest of the CI design's list (`test_airgap_helpers`, `test_qa_tier1_egress_guard`, `test_qa_airgap_happy_setup`, `test_qa_airgap_ipv6_edge_cases`, `test_airgap_modal_dom`) and the three tests that install the guard (`test_kb_capture`, `test_stt_flow`, `test_ocr_flow`).

**Environment note (py310).** The `py310` venv handed over had only the runtime dependencies of `huggingface_hub` and `httpx2`: no pytest, no fastapi, no starlette, so the conftest could not run. I installed the architect's own pinned Python 3.10 `[dev]` resolution into it (`uv pip install --no-deps -r <scratch>/resolve/req-3.10.txt`). httpx2 stays at 2.14.0 and huggingface-hub at 2.4.0; pytest 9.2.0 and starlette 1.7.0 were added. It is a scratch venv, so nothing in the worktree changed.

## Architect feedback required

**AF-1 (non-blocking; worked around with the same intent; please correct ARCHITECTURE.md).** "Test strategy" says the in-process tests monkeypatch `socket.gethostbyname` to return a TEST-NET-3 address (`203.0.113.7`) for names, so that the local check is deterministic. `ipaddress` calls the documentation ranges private: `ip_address("203.0.113.7").is_private` is `True` on CPython 3.10.22 and 3.11.17 (also 192.0.2.0/24 and 198.51.100.0/24). `arail.airgap.is_local_ip` returns `addr.is_private or ...`, so a name that resolves there is **local** and the guard lets it through. With the literal as written, EG-1 to EG-4 could never see `EgressBlocked`. Intent kept (a deterministic answer for names, no DNS query, no real host): the in-process tests patch only `socket.gethostbyname`, and return a globally routable address, `151.101.64.81`, the one `tests/test_egress_guard.py` and `tests/test_qa_airgap_bypass_attempts.py` already use. `getaddrinfo` stays real, so a guard regression is still a fast `ConnectError` on a `.invalid` name and never a connection to the patched address. The constant is `PUBLIC_TEST_IP` in `tests/egress_family_support.py`, with this reason in a comment. No design decision, contract or failure mode changes.
