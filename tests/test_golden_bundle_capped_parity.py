"""Cross-repo capped-path golden-bundle parity test (F7) — ARAIL side.

Mirror of qukaizen-ddac's ``tests/python/test_golden_bundle_capped_parity.py``.
``tests/fixtures/golden-bundle-capped/`` here is byte-identical to
qukaizen-ddac's ``tests/python/fixtures/golden-bundle-capped/`` (both
committed, not generated at test time — see
``sprints/2026-08-27-heavy-world-model/BUILD_LOG.md`` step 6 in qukaizen-ddac
for how they were produced). Unlike the original 2-term ``golden-bundle``
fixture (which always takes ``_skill_terms_capped``'s under-budget early
return and can never exercise the capped branch), this is a 300-term
synthetic corpus, deliberately over the measured SKILL budget, mixing
bare-string and typed ``{slug,rel}`` related edges across the SAME corpus
(the F5 degree-by-slug regression shape) — so a future selector rewrite
that reintroduces the ``str(dict)`` degree bug is caught by parity here,
which the 2-term fixture structurally cannot do.

This test asserts:
1. The golden fixture round-trips ARAIL's own consumer
   (``world_mount.load_bundle`` + ``verify_seal`` + ``check_compat`` +
   ``check_categories``).
2. A bundle freshly emitted through THIS repo's ``world_forge`` shim (i.e.
   through ``dac_world`` via the shim, exactly as ARAIL's portal would call
   it) with the same pinned spec/terms/``created_at`` is byte-identical to
   the committed fixture — proving the shim doesn't silently diverge from
   what qukaizen-ddac itself would emit.
3. The fixture actually exercises the capped branch (kept < 300 terms, the
   honest over-budget note is present) — proving this fixture is not vacuous.
